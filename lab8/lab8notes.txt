Project 3 is posted - due Wed Nov 9

This project is a bit more involved
    - Involves Makefiles (test now to make sure this works)

General idea: shortest path between two words


fit
cat
fat
rat
sit
car

Draw as a graph

Shortest "path" from fit to car?

Will use breadth-first search


///////////////////////////////

Review: person struct example (structs.c)

What was the downside to how the parameters were passed?

What is a better solution?

///////////////////////////////

--> usually we want to work with pointers to structs instead

--> this makes struct pointers work like objects in Java/C#

///////////////////////////////

Example: linked lists (of ints)

define a struct:


--> complete linked list program

//////////////////////////////

typedef: rename struct type

downside to having head be global?

other solution: pass a pointer

//////////////////////////////

Lab 8: implement a stack

use the stack to reverse the letters in a word

algorithm?
