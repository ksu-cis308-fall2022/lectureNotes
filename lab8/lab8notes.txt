Project 3 is posted - due Wed Nov 9

This project is a bit more involved
    - Involves Makefiles (test now to make sure this works)

--> new guide in text on remote access using VS Code
    (can use this if can't use gdb/make from your own machine)

/////////////////////////////////

Review: person struct example (structs.c)

What was the downside to how the parameters were passed?

What is a better solution?

///////////////////////////////

--> usually we want to work with pointers to structs instead

--> this makes struct pointers work like objects in Java/C#

///////////////////////////////

Example: linked lists (of ints)

define a struct:

typedef struct node {
    int data;
    struct node* next;
} NODE;


typedef: rename struct type

--> complete linked list program

//////////////////////////////

downside to having head be global?

other solution: pass a pointer

//////////////////////////////

Lab 8: implement a stack

use the stack to reverse the letters in a word

algorithm?
