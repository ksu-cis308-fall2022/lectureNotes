Project 2 posted, due Wed. Oct 12

(if you didn't get Proj1 working in time...might want to start earlier!)

/////////////////////

Today:

- more with pointers
- pointers to pointers
- dynamic memory allocation

/////////////////////

Pointers to pointers

A pointer can hold the memory address of another pointer


//Example

int x; 		

int* xp; 	

int** xpp; 	

x = 36; 	

//Make xp "point to" x
xp = &x;

//Make xpp "point to" xp
xpp = &xp;

//Use xp to change x to 72
*xp = 72;

//Use xpp to change x to 24
**xp = 24;


/////////////////////////

All memory so far has been allocated on the STACK.

Happens automatically when function is called.

Deallocation is done automatically when function ends.

Must be a constant size


To allocate memory whose size might change, or that we don't
know if we want until the program is running...allocate dynamically
(on the HEAP).

- malloc, calloc, realloc, free
- not allocated contiguously
- we must release this memory

//////////////////////

malloc - void* malloc(int numBytes)

use sizeof(type) to get the number of bytes needed for a type

store the result in type of pointer you want
    - some compilers require an explicit cast, but most do not
    - I tend to use an explicit cast for clarity


Example: dynamically allocate a size-10 array of ints

int* arr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*10);
arr[0] = 10;
*(arr+2) = 7;

arr++;
free(arr);

//////////////////////

free - void free(void* ptr)

releases the memory allocated at ptr so it can be used again

--> most implementations of malloc allocate a special spot
    to store the size of the allocated block, so it knows how
    much to free. This can be right before the allocated memory,
    but is compiler specific


Example: free array from before

//////////////////////////

calloc - void* calloc(int numElems, int sizePerElem);

Same idea as malloc, but inits to default value for the type

Need to free when done

//size 20 array of doubles initialized to 0

double* vals = calloc(20, sizeof(double));

/////////////////////////

realloc - void* realloc(void* origPtr, int newSize);

- used to allocate more space for any existing pointer
- returns one of:
    - NULL (if not enough new space is found)
    - The original pointer (if there is enough space at that location)
    - A new pointer to a different spot in memory (releases old memory)


double* test = (double*) calloc(2, sizeof(double));
double* temp = realloc(test, 10);

if (temp != NULL) {
    test = temp;
}

--> what can go wrong with this example?

/////////////////////

How would we dynamically allocate space for a 3x4 array of ints?

int** grid = malloc(sizeof(int*) * 3);
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    grid[i] = malloc(sizeof(int) * 4);
}

grid[0][2] = 17;

How would we free the memory?

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    free(grid[i]);
}
free(grid);
