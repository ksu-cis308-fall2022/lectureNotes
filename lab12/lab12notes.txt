Project 4 is due Wed Dec 7

Exam 2 is Tues Nov 29 (right after Fall break)

Paper-based, closed-notes, closed-computers.
1:30-2:30 (60 minutes) -- no lab activity

I'll be out of town from Fri Nov 18 until the end of fall break

Will likely be unavailable over email/Discord.
    --> you can still post to Discord...another student or a TA might answer

Quick exam review

Types of questions:
- Determine what is printed by a code fragment
- Write/use type definitions (using struct, enum, union, and/or typedef)
- Write/use preprocessor constants and macros
- Write a function following a specification, 
    or a "code snippet" that is several lines long
- Find errors in code
 

Topics covered:
- Structs
- Implementing data structures
- Pointers to structs, dynamically allocating and freeing memory with structs
- Header files and the #ifndef block
- Enum, union, typedef
- #define for constants and macros
- Function pointers (will cover today)
 

Topics from Exam 1 that might still appear on Exam 2:
- Reading user input with scanf (for ints, doubles, and chars) 
    and fgets (for strings)
- strcpy and strlen
- Pointers, dereferencing operator, address-of operator
- Call-by-reference functions

//////////////////////////////////

Here are some sample questions:

1) Define a type called ARTIST
    - can be either painter or singer
    - keep name, age, #years worked
    - painters keep type of paint (watercolor, oil, acrylic) and
        style (realism, abstract, impressionist)
    - singer keeps voice range (bass, tenor, alto, soprano) and
        number of concerts performed

typedef struct {
    char name[30];
    int age;
    int years;
    enum {painter, singer} type;
    union {
        struct {
            enum {watercolor, oil, acrylic} paintType;
            enum {realism, abstract, impressionist} style;
        } paintStuff;
        struct {
            enum {bass, tenor, alto, soprano} range;
            int concerts;
        } singStuff;
    } artStuff;
} ARTIST;


2) Create an array that can hold pointers to different artists.
Dynamically create a particular artist, fill with values.
Free memory.

ARTIST** collection = malloc(sizeof(ARTIST*)*10) ;

//initalizing index 2

//singer, "Bob Jones", 30, 5 yrs, bass, 2 concerts

collection[2] = malloc(sizeof(ARTIST));
collection[2]->type = singer;
strcpy(collection[2]->name, "Bob Jones");
collection[2]->age = 30;
collection[2]->years = 5;
collection[2]->artStuff.singStuff.range = bass;
collection[2]->artStuff.singStuff.concerts = 2;

free(collection[2]);
free(collection);



3) Write a function that adds a new node to the end of a linked list.

typedef struct node {
    int data;
    struct node* next;
} NODE;


//return updated head
NODE* addToEnd(NODE* head, int newData) {
    NODE* newnode = malloc(sizeof(NODE));
    newnode->data = newData;
    newnode->next = NULL;

    if (head == NULL) {
        return newnode;
    }
    else {
        //find the last node
        NODE* temp = head;
        while (temp->next != NULL  {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        //temp is last
        temp->next = newnode;
        return head;
    }
}

practice: try doing the same thing with:

void addToEnd(NODE** head, int newData)

/////////////////////////////////

Function pointers - pointers to executable code


/////

Declare:

    return_type (*ptr_name) (args);

ptr_name is the declared variable name, of type function pointer
    to a function that:
        - returns something of type return_type
        - takes parameters args


We MUST put () around (*ptr_name)
    ...or will interpret as declaring a REGULAR function
        returning return_type*

////

Initialize:

    ptr_name = someFunction;

    -OR-

    ptr_name = &someFunction;

Where someFunction has the specified return_type and args.

///////////////////////////////////

Example.

Suppose we have these functions:

int plus(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int minus(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

///

How could declare a function pointer to a function that
    returns an int and takes 2 int parameters:

    int (*op_ptr) (int, int);


--> How could we initialize our new function pointer?

op_ptr = minus;


///////////////////////////////

Using a function pointer:

- want to go to that executable code, specify parameters,
    accept returned value



result = ptr_name(params);

-OR-

result = (*ptr_name)(params);


--> call function pointed to by op_ptr, pass 4 and 3.

int answer = op_ptr(4, 3);

/////////////////////////////

Function pointer parameters.

See opPtrs example.

Define doOperation function that takes a function pointer.

(describe C's qsort)

////////////////////////////

Typedef and function pointers.

--> listing syntax for function pointer type is messy

--> nicer to rename the type using typedef

Typedef syntax:

    typedef return_type (*ptr_name) (args);

Now, ptr_name is a new type (of type function pointer to a function
    with the specified signature).


///////////

Example: Add typedef to create a new function pointer type name in
    operations example

Make doOperation parameter of that type instead

Create array of function pointers in main (using function pointer
    type name)

/////////////

Lab 12.

Similar idea.

Will define a function pointer to a pet filtering function
Will create 4 pet filter functions
Will use an array index to call appropriate function

(This is similar to part of Project 4)
